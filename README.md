# DOOMCrochetChartGenerator

Reads plaintext binary to generate a traditional filet crochet chart.
Can take any plaintext binary file to create patterns.

This repository includes the full DOOM binary plaintext file named 'DOOMbinary.txt', I do not claim ownership of the contents of this file, all rights
to id Software.

The output.png file is an example of the first 81,568 bits. I did only 16 columns since the game is 16-bit but you can of course adjust the pattern
size as need be with the 'width' and 'height' variables.
